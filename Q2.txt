1. What happens when the number of hidden nodes increase?
    When the number of hidden nodes in the hidden layer of a neural network increases, The network can fit the training data more accurately, potentially reducing training error and Increased Computational Cost

2. Can you explain the pattern of the accuracy when the hidden nodes increase?
    The pattern of accuracy when increasing the number of hidden nodes typically follows a non-linear behavior, influenced by the data, the task, and the initial network configuration.
